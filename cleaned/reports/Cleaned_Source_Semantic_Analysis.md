# Cleaned Directory Semantic Analysis

## Scope and Method
This analysis reviews all materials under `cleaned/`, emphasizing how each cluster of files contributes to the Monistic Box Calculus (MBC) knowledge base, operator semantics, and framework metadata.

## Conceptual Manuscripts (root of `cleaned/`)
The root contains foundational manuscripts such as **"VOLUME I — META-GENESIS THE ORIGIN OF STRUCTURE"**, **"THE SEMANTIC WAVE EQUATION"**, and tier-specific treatises (e.g., **"Tier-5 — λ-Family (Curvature _ Deformation).md"**, **"Tier-6 — ψ-Family (Semantic Oscillation _ Waves).md"**). These texts articulate theoretical underpinnings—geometry deformation, oscillatory semantics, summation rules, and cosmological framing—forming the narrative context for operator definitions and invariants.

## Tier and Operator Definitions
Files like **"Tier-1 δ-Family — Concise Definitions.md"**, **"Tier-3 — Π-Family (Evaluation _ Causal Order).md"**, **"Tier-4 — μ-Family (Local Weight _ Micro-Adjacency).md"**, and **"Tier 7 — Σ-Family (Semantic Summation _ Contraction Layer).md"** provide per-tier operator semantics, invariants, and routing behaviors. Collectively, they map the progression from primitive entities through higher-order composition, detailing curvature, oscillation, summation, polarity, evolution, and meta-layer interactions.

## Operators Subdirectory
The `operators/` tree supplies machine-readable complements to the narrative texts. Canonical JSON5 files (e.g., `canonical/psi_commutativity.json`, `canonical/lambda_delta_composition.json`) encode formal statements, conditions, and variants for ψ commutativity and λ–δ composition. Selection utilities (e.g., `selection/context_selection_guide.json`) document routing heuristics and context cues, aligning operator usage with semantic intent.

## Framework Pointer System (`MBC_Framework_v4/`)
The `MBC_Framework_v4` directory implements a structured pointer system. The master index (`mbc_framework_index.json`) tracks framework versions, completeness by directory, and growth metrics, while pointer files (e.g., `00_Meta/framework_metadata.pointer.json`, `01_Primitives/*.pointer.json`, `02_Tiers/Tier_01_delta/tier_01_metadata.pointer.json`, `03_MetaOperators/meta_operator_pack.pointer.json`) bind narrative sources to extraction instructions, cross-references, and impact notes. This system operationalizes the textual corpus into navigable, reference-based metadata.

## Reports Subdirectory
Existing reports (e.g., `COMPREHENSIVE_LIBRARY_ANALYSIS.md`, `Completeness_Summary.md`, `Pooled_Variant_System_Completeness_Report.md`, `Pointer_System_Summary.md`) capture prior audits, completeness checks, and variant analyses. They provide historical validation context and highlight areas requiring further formalization (e.g., selective commutativity, rewrite systems, cross-links).

## Additional Metadata
The root includes meta-summaries like `WORK_COMPLETED_SUMMARY.md` and `agentized.json` (JSON5), which outline agentization strategy, MCP/Router layering, and execution roles. Local settings in `.claude/settings.local.json` define tool permissions. Collectively, these files bridge philosophical intent, operational governance, and machine-readable configuration.

## Completeness Observations
- **Narrative coverage is broad**: all tiers have descriptive manuscripts, with multiple cosmology and invariant expositions reinforcing thematic coherence.
- **Machine-readable coverage is partial**: JSON5 canonical definitions exist for key λ/ψ operator interactions, and pointer files focus on meta, primitives, Tier-01 δ, and meta-operators; higher-tier pointers and rewrite systems remain open.
- **Validation traceability** is anchored in the reports directory and the master pointer index, which document expected tests (e.g., variant consistency) and completeness metrics.
