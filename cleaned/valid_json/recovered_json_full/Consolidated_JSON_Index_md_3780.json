    "name": "Canonical λ-Theorem — λ Generates Modal Curvature",
    "type": "theorem",
    "tier": 5,
    "family": "λ",
    "intent": "Formalize λ as the curvature of the mode-augmented deviation connection and show that all modal curvature is generated by the mode field M.",
    "domain": {
      "objects": ["Box"],
      "structures": ["δ-family", "Φ-projection", "Π-evaluation", "ψ-mode", "μ-weight"],
      "connections": ["∇0 = δ", "∇M = δ + M"]
    },
    "statement": {
      "decomposition": "For any Box B with mode field M, λ(B) = λ_curv(B) + λ_mode(B) + λ_cross(B). λ_curv is the curvature of δ alone, λ_mode is linear in M, λ_cross is nonlinear (quadratic or higher) in M.",
      "generation": "λ_mode(B) = δ(M)(B) + [δ, M](B) and λ_cross(B) = M ∧ M(B). Thus λ_mode and λ_cross depend only on M and vanish when M = 0.",
      "modal_flatness": "λ_modal(B) = 0 (i.e. λ_mode(B) = 0 and λ_cross(B) = 0) if and only if there exists a local mode potential U such that M = δU up to gauge, making ∇M mode-flat."
