{ "title": "The Σ–Tri-Unity Normal Form Theorem", "statement": "For any Box B and any composition of operators drawn from δ, Φ, Π, μ, λ, ψ, Θ, the application of Σ yields a unique Normal Form NF(B) that is independent of the order of δ, Φ, Π and their commutations. That is, if p1 and p2 are any two valid operator paths in the Tri-Unity cube, then Σ(p1(B)) \= Σ(p2(B)).", "formal": \[ "1. δ, Φ, Π pairwise commute in the cube: δΦ \= Φδ, δΠ \= Πδ, ΦΠ \= ΠΦ.", "2. Σ commutes up to contraction: Σδ \= Σδ, ΣΦ \= ΣΦ, ΣΠ \= ΣΠ.", "3. Σ is idempotent and terminal: ΣΣ \= Σ.", "4. Σ is polarity-aware via Θ and reduces any polarized pair (X,Y) to a single contracted value.", "5. Σ is path-independent on the δ–Φ–Π cube: Σ∘p1 \= Σ∘p2 for all paths p1,p2.", "6. Therefore NF(B) \= Σ(δ^a Φ^b Π^c B) is unique for all a,b,c ∈ ℕ." \], "conclusion": "Σ closes the Tri-Unity algebra and defines the unique semantic residue NF(B)." }
