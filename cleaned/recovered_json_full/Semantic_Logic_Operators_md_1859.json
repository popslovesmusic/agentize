{ "name": "Θ-Σ-Π-aware Semantic Logic Normal Form (SLNF)", "description": \[ "1. No IMPLIES, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.", "2. NECESSITY and POSSIBILITY appear only in front of formulas with NOT pushed to atoms.", "3. NOT occurs only on atomic predicates, not on compound formulas, quantifiers, or modalities.", "4. Quantifiers are in prenex or quasi-prenex form where possible: a block of FORALL/EXISTS at the front.", "5. Boolean core in each scope is constructed from AND, OR, and atomic NOT using associative/commutative/absorptive/distributive laws.", "6. Θ-Σ-Π updates preserve classical truth under Π and refine polarity/support under Θ and Σ." \], "allowed\_operators": \[ "AND", "OR", "NOT", "FORALL", "EXISTS", "NECESSITY", "POSSIBILITY" \] }
