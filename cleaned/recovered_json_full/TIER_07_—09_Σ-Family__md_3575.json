{ // \============================================================ // TIER 07 — Σ-FAMILY METADATA // Summation / Contraction / Aggregation Layer // \============================================================ "tier": 7, "name": "Σ-Family", "role": "Semantic Summation / Tensor Contraction / Aggregation", "description": \` Σ is the universal contraction operator of IGSOA. It reduces dimensionality, aggregates semantic fields, collapses ψ-mode superpositions, and forms evaluable Π-states. Σ acts as the counterpart to δ (expansion) and ψ (oscillation). \`, "core\_principles": \[ "Σ reduces degrees of freedom while preserving semantic class boundaries (Φ).", "Σ contracts ψ-modes into stable Π-evaluable forms.", "Σ interacts with μ-weights as weighted summation.", "Σ preserves Ω-consistency and never creates contradictions.", "Σ is associative but not necessarily commutative in semantic space." \], "invariants": { "Rank-Reduction Invariant": "Σ must strictly decrease tensor rank unless special case Σ⁰.", "Weighted-Integrity Invariant": "Σ(μ-weighted domain) must keep μ normalization.", "Modal-Contraction Invariant": "ψ superpositions must collapse to stable Σ-states.", "Semantic-Class Preservation": "Φ-classes must remain well-defined after contraction." } }
